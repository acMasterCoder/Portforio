  <h3>          I was born in china. Later I moved to the U.S. When I was 8, my mom have brought me to america. For 4 years, I have stayed in boston, I went to a public school near my home. Hear around my home, it's pretty nice. Good place to live, I would say. At the age of 8, I came here with my dad, my mother, and my brother. One year after, when I was 9, my dad and my brother left to travel back to china. About a month after my dad and brother traveled back, covid-19 started. This virus lasted very long time. For 3 years, I did not get a chance to met my brother or my birthplace.<h3>
  <h3>I started coding about a year and a half ago. (Actually I started with some scratch coding way before I even knew python. But scratch is just too easy to count, right? Yeah, I thought so. ) First I started a winter club, in the club I was introduced to python and learned the cool things that you can do with it. After the club is complete, I keep on coding. Level M have seemed to be a pretty good choice for me, so I started with that. I stayed in level M for a pretty long time, almost a year. Than I finally graduated level M. I started my level 4 classes about a half year ago, I learned many new things in level 4. Probably learned more than all the other classes together.</h3>
